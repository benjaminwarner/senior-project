# Introduction
This repo houses my senior project for Boise State University. My senior project was on creating a model for an epidemic using numbers for COVID-19.

The expectation of this project was to gain an understanding of what academic research is actually like. This means, that I was not expected to have a fully fleshed out answer/model. It also means, that I am expected to produce a deliverable that can be handed over to my advisor (e.g. a PDF or a presentation). 

# TODO
- [ ] read about the different methods to use (e.g. SIRE, which stands for susceptible, infected, recovered, and expired)
- [ ] review solving ODEs (initial value problems)
- [ ] review MATH 365 AIDS problem from 2019, and translate to python
- [ ] review Google drive shared with me from Dr. Kopera (problem 4, SIRE problem)
- [ ] do background research
- [x] extract Idaho COVID case numbers

# SIR Modeling

SIR stands for Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and it basically encapsulates the idea that an epidemic can be modeled using those three population groups. 

* S(t) (those who have not yet been infected)
* I(t) (those who can currently spread the disease)
* R(t) (those who are now immune and cannot contract or spread the disease)

Each above function is one of time t; all of them are differential functions, since we're interested in how they change over time.

# Resources
* Google scholar for real scientific articles
  * Be sure to cross reference articles and be careful with what data is selected/used from articles
  * Looking at sources used in scientific articles is a good way to see what the author was looking at
  * Additionally, look for articles that source a found article
* Google for just quick research

# Questions to Consider
* How bad could the numbers have gotten if we didn't do a lockdown?
* How effective was the lockdown?
  * How long should the lockdown have lasted to be the most effective?
* How effective is using a face mask?
* Can vaccines be represented in the model?
  * What happens if everyone was vaccinated at once (or rather, if they were vaccinated ASAP)?
  * What happens if we vaccinate in waves?
* Can I create my own model that is more effective than what's currently available?
  * This could be a project all on its own.
